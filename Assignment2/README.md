# Assignment2
This is the first assignment for AME 220 Fall 2015

The idea is to create a slideshow that could create slides from an array of given images/links. It is required to have two animations, slide and fade. I have also included a standard animation (just changes the images without any effects), which is the initial slideshow transition setting.

If you hit the “toggle animation” button, you could cycle through standard, fade, and slide. An alert is given to show which animation is set.
